I am frustrated by the driver of sabre hifi on linux. I search for many sites but there is no answer. I decide to create a project to work with that. I don't have enough knowledge about that so if you are interested in this project, please star it. After we get enough people, we can discuss and make progress.

I made some progress on this but it may not work for others. What I did is flash a unlcoked bios (chipset menu in bios unlocked), then adjust `DSP` to be enabled in PCHIO/HDAudio configuration. Also, the patch is required as well. The critical part is to put 0x1b(VREF) pin to something over HIZ, it triggered both `AARELAY` and `AAOP1622_EN`, I used hda_analyzer python script to do the job. Then use `pavucontrol` to set the output to be SPDIF since the board use SPDIF to transfer audio between alc898 codec and es9018 DAC. After that, It should output some music.
